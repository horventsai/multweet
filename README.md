##Purpose

This app allows users to share their thoughts on twitter with 140+ characters.

If the tweet is longer than 140 characters, the app will split the message into
multiple 133 character long tweets and send starting from the last segment of the 
message so that the message can be read from top to bottom on twitter's feed.
